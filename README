Gameplay Basics:

Place tiles from your hand while dealing with monsters and fulfilling
quests. Moving onto a blank space will place the tile shown in the bottom right
of the screen. You can rotate that tile before you place it. Spaces you can play
on are marked with a square, and corners are marked to indicate good
orientations. Monsters take a turn when you place a tile.

Monsters:

Monsters restrict your movement. If you are adjacent to a monster when you start
your turn, you must fight it on your turn (some exceptions apply).

Tiles:

Roads and rivers must connect up in ways that make sense, but the other terrain
need not match. Diligently matching terrain will give you bonuses.

Some tiles have a quest on them. Each quest is to kill a certain number of
monster. Completing a quest will give you bonuses.

| Town    | Towns give more matching bonuses than other terrains.           |
|         |                                                                 |
