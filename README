Gameplay Basics:

Place tiles from your hand while dealing with monsters and fulfilling
quests. Moving onto a blank space will place the tile currently in your
hand. You can rotate that tile before you place it. Spaces that you can't play
in are marked with an X. Monsters take a turn when you place a tile.

Monsters:

Monsters block your movement. If you are adjacent to a monster when you start
your turn, you must fight it on your turn by moving towards it (some exceptions
apply). You cannot evade a monster by placing a new tile. When you fight a
monster, you also fight all of its friends, and you will be attacked by the
entire group of connected monsters.

Tiles:

Tiles have terrain on them. Roads and rivers must connect up in ways that make
sense, but the other tiles need not match. Diligently matching tiles will,
however, give you bonuses.

Some tiles have a quest on them. Each quest is to kill a certain number of
monster. Completing a quest will give you bonuses.

| Terrain | Description                                                       |
|---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Forest  | Monsters will never leave a forest after entering a forest. They  |
|         | may wander around in the forest, but they won't leave it.         |
|         |                                                                   |
| Town    | Monsters cannot enter a town through its walls, but they can come |
|         | in through undefended parts.                                      |
|         |                                                                   |
| Grass   | It's just grass.                                                  |
|         |                                                                   |
| Road    | You can avoid fighting monsters by moving along a road.           |
|         |                                                                   |
| River   | Rivers slow you down. Monsters will take an extra turn for each   |
|         | river movement you do.                                            |
