  - preview the outcomes of the routing
    - you'll see if they get hurt in a fight or etc
  - between turns, monsters can spawn or move around on the map
  - some tiles have an NPC that offers a quest and a reward
    - reward:
      - on dr, it's just tiles
      - here: tiles, restore hp, upgrade character
    - quests:
      - fight monster
      - collect materials
  - reward for clearing all monsters out of a region
    - greater for bigger regions?
    - +n tiles?
    - heal?

3 dwarves in a trenchcoat
  - dwarves want access to the elf-only dungeon so they wear a disguise
  - each dwarf has its own slot in the turn order
    - can only move on bottom dwarf's turn
    - can only use items/magic on middle dwarf's turn
    - can only only attack on top dwarf's turn
    - or do them all on one turn because you have three actions because 3 dwarves
  - tactically disband the collective unit to take individual actions
    - or get knocked over by an enemy or trap
    - but alarms go off if an elf spots you
  - each dwarf only has one stat, strength, and that stat derives to different attributes depending on position
    - movement speed/dexterity is strength of bottom dwarf
  - each dwarf can carry a different weapon, so you might need to reorder dwarves on context
  - some enemies are in trenchcoats also, but sometimes they're just wearing trenchcoats and sometimes
    they are other creatures stacked and in disguise

gummy bear mafia
  - less a concrete idea and more something to play with in a candy theme
  - if things are gummy they can fuse and squish together

pre-rolled attacks
  - attack rolls happen for all of your stuff before you pick them
  - choose among them knowing the results
  - the choices branch the future RNG as well, and maybe you want to miss now to hit later sometimes
  - you have an "insight" resource
  - you can toggle between normal actions and "reading mode"
  - action in reading mode consume insight and are rewindable


split-world stealth in physical space and murderhobo in cyberspace
  - the protagonist is super physically weak. loses all fights
  - they're an elite hacker and can stomp things in the digital world
  - the physical enemies are cyborgs with implants that can be turned against them if hacked
    - sight implant: more perception, 
        hacks:
          - blind them 
          - detect where they are looking
          - make them see hallucinations
    - arm implant: more powerful
        hacks:
          - disarm
          - force attack
    - leg implant: faster, but when hacked, can be immobilized, or made to kick things
    - comm link: informs allies of things, but when hacked, can feed distracting information
    - traps: hack to make them hit enemies instead
    - robot enemies: hack to make them explode

involuntary time travel
  - you have an illness/curse/something that causes you to travel back in time by n turns every n turns
  - when you do this, you leave behind time clones
  - interacting with these time clones hurts you
    - "time damage"
    - littering the map with clones is the main source of pressure to move forward
  - you can use the time travel to clone items
    - cloned consumables don't necessarily have an effect again
    - maybe cloned consumables do time damage when you eat/drink them
  - there are things on the map which increase n
    - this effectively brings you further into the future
    - this is the only way you can get further into the future
  - some types of special damage cause n to go down
    - it also moves forward your reset point by the same amount
  eg: you're at t=100 with n=5
      you're looping through turns 96,97,98,99,100
      if you take damage so that n=4, you instead loop through
                                      97,98,99,100
  - this can be presented to the player as time: remaining / rewind_amount
                                                  ^ turns before rewind  ^
                                                                         | n
                                                 pickups add to both numbers
         t=100         x......
         t=105                x
         rewind t=100         x
  - "chronovirus"
  - buttons that open doors when you stand on them
  - buttons that activate deathtraps when you step on them
    - lure monsters into it
  - shops could be fun and irritating
